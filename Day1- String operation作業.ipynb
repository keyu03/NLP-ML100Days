back,/THE PLACE WAS FAIRLY CLEAN BUT THE OOD SIMPLY WASN'T WORTH IT,/this place lacked style!!/THE SANGRIA WAS ABOUT HALF OF A GLASS WINE FULL AND WAS $12, RIDICULOUS,/don't boThercoming here,/THE MEAT WAS PRETTY DRY, I HAD THE LICED BRISKET AND PULLED PORK,/The building itself seems pretty neat, The athroom is pretty trippy, but i wouldn't eat here again,/IT WAS EQUALLY AWFUL,/probably not in a hurry to go back,/VERY SLOW AT SEATING EVEN WITH RESERVATION,/not good by any stretch of The magination,/THE CASHEW CREAM SAUCE WAS BLAND AND THE EGETABLES WERE UNDERCOOKED,/The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat,/IT WAS A BIT TOO SWEET, NOT REALLY SPICY ENOUGH, AND LACKED FLAVOR,/i was very disappointed!!/THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE AND WAY OVERPRICED,/maybe it's just Thei vegetarian fare, but i've been twice and i thought it was average at best,/IT WASN'T BUSY AT ALL AND NOW WE KNOW WHY,/The tables outside are also dirty a lot of The ime and The workers are not always friendly and helpful with The menu,/THE AMBIANCE HERE DID NOT FEEL LIKE A BUFFET SETTING, BUT MORE OF A DOUCHEY INDOOR GARDEN FOR TEA AND BISCUITS,/con: spotty service,/THE FRIES WERE NOT HOT, AND NEITHERWAS MY BURGER,/but ThenThey came back cold,/THEN OUR FOOD CAME OUT, DISAPPOINTMENT ENSUED,/The real disappointment was our waiter,/MY HUSBAND SAID SHE WAS VERY RUDE,,, DID NOT EVEN APOLOGIZE FOR THE AD FOOD OR ANYTHING,/The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach,/INSULTS, PROFOUND DEUCHEBAGGERY, AND HAD TO GO OUTSIDE FOR A SMOKE BREAK WHILE SERVING JUST TO SOLIDIFY IT,/if someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?/SHE WAS QUITE DISAPPOINTED ALTHOUGH SOME BLAME NEEDS TO BE PLACED AT HER DOOR,/after all The ave reviews i couldn't wait to eat here,,,,,,what a disappointment!/DEL TACO IS PRETTY NASTY AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED IF POSSIBLE,/it's not hard to make a decent hamburger,/BUT I DON'T LIKE IT,/hell no will i go back/WE'VE HAVE GOTTEN A MUCH BETTER SERVICE FROM THE IZZA PLACE NEXT DOOR THAN THE SERVICES WE RECEIVED FROM THIS RESTAURANT,/i don't know what The ig deal is about this place, but i won't be back \"ya'all\",/I IMMEDIATELY SAID I WANTED TO TALK TO THE ANAGER BUT I DID NOT WANT TO TALK TO THE GUY WHO WAS DOING SHOTS OF FIREBALL BEHIND THE BAR,/The ambiance isn't much better,/UNFORTUNATELY, IT ONLY SET US UP FOR DISAPPPOINTMENT WITH OUR ENTREES,/The food wasn't good,/YOUR SERVERS SUCK, WAIT, CORRECTION, OUR SERVER HEIMER SUCKED,/what happened next was pretty,,,,off putting,/TOO BAD CAUSE I KNOW IT'S FAMILY OWNED, I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS PLACE,/overpriced for what you are getting,/I VOMITED IN THE ATHROOM MID LUNCH,/i kept looking at The ime and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food,/I HAVE BEEN TO VERY FEW PLACES TO EAT THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD I EVER RETURN TO, AND THIS TOPS THE IST,/we started with The una sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh,/FOOD WAS BELOW AVERAGE,/it sure does beat The achos at The movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant,/ALL IN ALL, HA LONG BAY WAS A BIT OF A FLOP,/The problem i have is that Theycharge $11,99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables),/SHRIMP- WHEN I UNWRAPPED IT (I LIVE ONLY 1/2 A MILE FROM BRUSHFIRE) IT WAS LITERALLY ICE COLD,/it lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry,/IT REALLY IS IMPRESSIVE THAT THE LACE HASN'T CLOSED DOWN,/i would avoid this place if you are staying in The irage,/THE REFRIED BEANS THAT CAME WITH MY MEAL WERE DRIED OUT AND CRUSTY AND THE OOD WAS BLAND,/spend your money and time some place else,/A LADY AT THE ABLE NEXT TO US FOUND A LIVE GREEN CATERPILLAR IN HER SALAD,/The resentation of The food was awful,/I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW DISAPPOINTED I WAS,/i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking,/APPETITE INSTANTLY GONE,/overall i was not impressed and would not go back,/THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS UNDERWHELMING, AND I THINK WE'LL JUST GO TO NINJA SUSHI NEXT TIME,/Then, as if i hadn't wasted enough of my life Ther, They poured salt in The wound by drawing out The time it took to bring The check,\n"
